Loki Watch is a really simple app designed to help potty train dogs. It consists of nothing more than a timer that helps keep track of a dog's last trip outside with several resetters (feeding/going outside).

It was designed primarily to help me keep a regular potty schedule with my puppy.

TO DO:
- Include an alarm when the counter hits 00:00:00
- Add some flair (background/better buttons)
- Include additional variables (Went outside -> Successful potty trip?)
- Keep track of multiple forms of waste
